                <p id = "fc1">My dog Phoebe joined our family on January 9th 2013. 
                    I went with my father and brother to pick her up from a rescue shelter.
                    As soon as we arrived she came right up to us to play. As we were playing
                    with her and the other dogs, the caretaker yelled at other dogs, and Phoebe 
                    went to hide. We all knew then that we had to have her to give her a good life.

                <p id = "fc2">We started training Phoebe almost as soon as we got her. We 
                    started by taking her out to the front yard with us when we 
                    went out. If while we were out she would try to leave the yard 
                    without our ok, then we would yell to get her attention, and then 
                    take her inside. She learned to stay within the yard until we said so 
                    within the first month.

                <p id = "fc3">Through the years during our walks we managed to get Phoebe trained to
                    the point that she no longer needs a leash. She will obey all commands 
                    we give her immediately. All through the neighborhood everyone knows Phoebe
                    as part of our family. I had a neighbor that I don't really know well ask me 
                    at my job how Phoebe was doing. She goes with us to all of the neighborhood 
                    watch meetings, and thanks to that she became well known to all of the neighbors 
                    as the mascot.
